# Dart Null-Aware Operator Getter Bug

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with the null-aware operator (`??`) used in getter methods in Dart.  The bug arises when a nullable variable is accessed through a getter that uses the null-aware operator to provide a default value.  While this approach is commonly used, it can mask potential errors and lead to unexpected behavior in certain scenarios.

## Bug Description

The `bug.dart` file contains the problematic code. The `MyClass` has a nullable integer variable (`_myVariable`). The getter `myVariable` uses the null-aware operator to return 0 if `_myVariable` is null.  This can prevent errors, but it also hides the fact that the variable was actually null.  A better solution would be to handle the null case explicitly and potentially throw an exception or handle it in a more robust manner.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a corrected implementation that addresses the issue by adding explicit null checks and providing clearer error handling. This method makes it apparent when the value is null, enabling more controlled and predictable behavior.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory.
3. Run `dart bug.dart` and observe the output.
4. Run `dart bugSolution.dart` and observe the corrected behavior.
